# Automated Credit Risk Report Generator

This project is a web-based platform that automates the generation of credit risk reports for companies based on uploaded financial documents. Built using **Django (backend)** and **HTML/CSS (frontend)**, the system parses PDF financial statements, extracts relevant financial metrics using `pdfplumber` and `re`, computes credit risk scores using a weighted scoring model, and generates a downloadable report.



## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload company information and financial documents (PDFs)
- Automated parsing of:
  - **Balance Sheet**
  - **Income Statement**
  - **Cash Flow Statement**
- Extraction of key and derived financial metrics using `pdfplumber` (for reading) and `re` (for pattern matching)
- Credit risk scoring using custom logic with weights and thresholds
- Preview of credit score before download
- Generate and download a detailed DOCX report of the analysis
